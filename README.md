# AspNetCoreWithAurelia
A skeleton ASP.Net Core application with an Aurelia front end.

I started this before I found the Dot Net Core Spa Templates bundle had an Aurelia option (and that had lots of bespoke stuff like using ASP.Net Core's webpack support). 

There are different branches for different front-end frameworks. Currently there are branches for using Aurelia-UX and Bootstrap 4. I might get around to adding support for Foundation, Aurelia-Materialize Bridge etc. at some point.
